  <psk-chapter title="EDFS sub-project">
    <psk-img src="PrivateSky/EDFS.png" title="Relation between the EDFS major concepts"></psk-img>

     PrivateSky efforts to offer to create a database for storing private data conducted us to propose the  EDFS (Encrypted Distributed File System) that is both a file system and a blockchain based distributed database.
    The main purpose of EDFS is to serve as near-chain (off-chain) storage for blockchains.
     To properly understand EDFS capabilities we need to understand 4 concepts:  BAR archives,CSBs, Secret Smart Contracts, Self-Sovereign Applications.

    <psk-chapter title="BAR file format">
      A BAR is an archive format (to replace ZIP,TAR file formats) so is just a container for files.
      As a difference from the regular archives, BARs are created to follow this list of properties:
      <ol>
        <li>
          BARs can be stored in files but also in cloud encrypted with a secret key that we call SEED.
        </li>
        <li>
          A SEED is an encyption key but it is used to cryptographically derivate an identifier for the BAR archive. This identifier is called LSEED (Location Seed) and can be used to locate a BAR file.
          The name of the file and the LSEED are called "Aliases".
        </li>

        <li>
          BARs are stored in cloud as compressed Bricks. A large file is divided into Bricks. A Brick is just an encrypted buffer identifiable by its hash (after compression and encryption).
          Each Brick is encrypted with a different gey (randomly generated)
        </li>
        <li>
          A specific version of a BAR is identifiable by cryptographic hash  of it's content by computing the hash of the hashes of all its Bricks.
        </li>
      </ol>

      For storing those Bricks, we have created the EDFS storage service but we plan to have similar storages that are using various cloud storages (Dropbox , Google Drive, Amazon S3,IPFS, etc)

      <ul>
        Therefore a BAR is:
        <li>
          An archive storable in cloud as Bricks
        </li>
        <li>
          Anchorable in blockchains by it's HASH
        </li>

        <li>
          Referencable in blockchain by an Alias
        </li>

        <li>
          Retrievable from cloud by a SEED
        </li>
      </ul>


    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="CSB concept">
      <ul>
        A CSB (Cloud Safe Box) is a BAR archive conatining
        <li> An embedded ledger (a blockchain as  chained history of transaction grouped in blocks) </li>
        <li> Constitution (code) </li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      All the embedded files are reflected by records in blockchain (called assets).
      </div>
      </div>
      The control on the blockchain records is guarded by blockchain transactions
      </div>
      </div>
      Embedded Web Applications are implemented without any servers (service workers)
      </div>
      <div>
      In a sense a CSB is a sidechain but not a usual one.       A CSB it is not a permanently online blockchain (Sidechain). We call it as an offline Sidechain.
      It is a new breed of blockchain: offline blockchains.  There are no online P2P nodes communicating between them all the time. We have only an “Indirect communication” by anchoring the new HASH of
      the BAR (A CSB is a BAR) in a blockchain and by adding new Bricks in the cloud storages.
      </div>
      <div>
      From the programmer perspective CSBs are self-refreshing archives that can be read or updated only in those nodes with access to the SEED (encryption key).
      The archive is containing a chained history of events (like in an event sourcing implemented as a blockchain) that at each self-refreshing moment are used
      for automated verification of the security and business rules.
      The verification and consensus happens “offline” like in “when needed to read or write” and all the history of events  (even invalid ones) remain stored as Bricks.
      If a node is writing wrong transactions, they will be ignored by the network.
      </div>

      <div>
        The consensus at the level of a CSB depends heavily on the consensus happening properly in the blockchain in which the CSB is anchored in. We can call it “anchored consensus”.
      </div>
    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="Secret Smart Contracts">
       A set of related asset types and transactions types from the constitution of a CSB blockchain are called in PrivateSky with the term: Secret Smart Contracts.
      <ol>
        Key differences compared with smart contracts:
        <li>
          Their existence is visible only to a small group of users (because they are embedded in CSBs)
        </li>
        <li>
          Executed in security contexts: automatically use the secret keys available to the current user(keys stored in CSBs)
        </li>
        <li>
          Verifiable only by a selected group
        </li>
      </ol>
    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="Self-Sovereign Applications (SSApps)">
       Self-Sovereign Applications are quite similar with Progressive Web Applications because Service Workers are used.
      <div>
        A Service Worker is essentially a JavaScript file that runs separately from the main browser thread, intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources from the cache, and delivering push messages.
      </div>

      We are talking about SSApp as about a Distributed Application (DApp) implemented with tehnologies for Web Applications and in such a way that all its code and data is stored in CSBs.
      The UI and "server" side part of the SSApp says in CSBs. The execution of SSApp happens without distant servers (there is no external server doing any processing!) but a server is simulated using service workers.

    </psk-chapter>

    Hopefully, we understand now how EDFS is a nice  programming abstraction to make it easier to work with encrypted and distributed data.
