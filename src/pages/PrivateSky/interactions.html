  <psk-chapter title="Interactions: swarms sent to clients and recieved back ">
     Typically a swarm (as a choreography) or as a blockchain transaction is started in a different application from the place where is executed. Typically a client is starting swarms or transaction on a remote node.
    The swarm communication paradigms is trying to go beyond the request/answer pattern of the client/server (RPC) paradigm while still keeping things simple for programmers.
    Even in a simple setup involving communication between two parties the same communication process (lets call them client and server for simplicity) could involve a multi-step communication between client and server.
    For example, the server could require additional information from the client (for example input of a secret key)  continue with processing an additional steps ( phases) and then returning some results.

  <psk-chapter title="Benefits of the interactions">
    <psk-list>
        The main benefit is that you could have different code on the client side while still using the same server side swarm
        Abstract the remote part of the swarm. It is possibile to start swarms over
        Another benefit is that the swarm communication paradigm can be used properly on the server
