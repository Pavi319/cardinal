  <psk-description>
    PrivateSky perspective for a typical blockchain architecture is summarized in the above picture. We have identified 5 layers in the architecture as will be described below. We see the architecture layers as types of concerns that are reflected in the system quality attributes.

  <psk-chapter title="Networking Layer">

    This layer is focused on setting the rules and communication capabilities of the physical nodes doing network communication. For public blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum) this layer contains the concerns of P2P communication, node booting, etc. For permissioned DLTs, it reflects concerns regarding restricting access while allowing allows communication to the entities that have permission. For permissioned DLTs this layer could imply the need to configure VPNs, SDNs, Certificate Authorities, etc.

  <psk-chapter title="  Blockchain Logical View">

    This layer contains one or multiple blockchain domains. Each blockchain domain could use a different version of the software (a fork) or even different technology entirely. Not all members should replicate all domains (for privacy this is actually a requirement). A special blockchain domain is the Blockchain Root as in PrivateSky we propose that any non-root blockchain to be anchored in the Blockchain Root to benefit from the security offered by the fact that the root domain is replicated by all participants (the whole consortium).
    This layer is a logical layer, it does not exist as actual nodes but at a conceptual level (for example a shared ledger it is consistent at the logical level because at each moment each physical node will have a slightly different state)

  <psk-chapter title="Physical Blockchain Replicas and Storages">
    At this layer, we have actual blockchain software running. The software at this level can be the type of blockchain nodes that participate in the consensus, blockchain nodes that are used for caching (do not participate in the consensus but serve the consumers at the top level) and the software that provides the data storage services.  The storage services are storing (typically encrypted) data that is directly anchored in blockchains. In PrivateSky we call these storages near-chains as they are special types of encrypted blockchains to which access is shared only with a limited group of users.
    The code belonging to this layer will run in a containerized environment that typically should stay outside the company firewalls (in the DMZ area) as the communication should be performed with similar nodes from other organisations.

  </psk-chapter>

  <psk-chapter title="Containerised APIs">
    In this layer of architecture, we have positioned the containers that offer services (typically REST services) to the applications that implement useful use-cases. By containers we mean Linux containers (eg docker). This layer is executed in a trusted environment, typically each company or participant should run its separate copy. The blockchain governance software should be executed at this level.  Containers could be executed in DMZ but access to the services offered will typically be restricted to the company's internal network.
  </psk-chapter>


  <psk-chapter title="Far-Chain: Blockchain Applications">
    In this layer of architecture are all the applications and systems that use data extracted from the blockchains but are not directly connected to the blockchain. This layer is connected with blockchain through the Containerised APIs. This layer is called far-chain because it is the most logical and physically distant from blockchains. Typically, all the code from this layer is a regular enterprise code that uses APIs as a source or destination of the manipulated data and ideally is not concerned about the strictness introduced by blockchains. This layer is executed in a trusted environment and its human users should trust this environment.
