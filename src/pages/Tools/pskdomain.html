            <b>create csb </b><i>alias constitutionPath</i><br>
            Creates a privatesky domain as a new CSB that contains the constitution at <i>constitutionPath</i>. This
            command generates a CSB whose SEED is associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <i>alias</i>
            argument. A prompt that requires the insertion of a PIN will appear. The provided PIN will be required for
            all subsequent commands.<br><br>

        <psk-card>
            <b>create bar </b><i>alias localPath</i><br>
            Creates a BAR that stores the files at <i>localPath</i>. The command generates a BAR whose SEED is
            associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <i>alias</i> argument.<br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>add folder </b> <i>barAlias barPath localPath</i><br>
            Adds the files at <i>localPath</i> to the BAR whose SEED is associated locally with the <i>barAlias</i>
            argument. The files are added in BAR at bar <i>barPath</i>.<br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>update constitution</b> <i>domainAlias constitutionPath</i><br>
            Replaces the constitution in the domain whose SEED is associated with <i>domainAlias</i> with the
            constitution at <i>constitutionPath</i>.<br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>add agent</b> <i>domainAlias agentAlias</i><br>
            Adds agent <i>agentAlias</i> to the domain whose SEED is associated with <i>domainAlias</i>. A prompt for
            PIN introduction will appear.<br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>publish</b> <i>domainAlias remoteAddress</i><br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>set pin</b><br>
            Allows the change of PIN. Firstly, a prompt that requires the current PIN will appear. After the PIN is
            validated another prompt will appear for the introduction of the new PIN.<br><br>
        </psk-card>
        <psk-card>
            <b>anchor</b> <i>anchoreeAlias anchoratorAlias</i><br>
            Allows the anchoring of the domain whose SEED is associated locally with the <i>anchoreeAlias</i> argument
            inside the domain whose SEED is associated with the <i>anchoratorAlias</i>. By anchoring it is meant that
            “anchorator” domain contains the hash of the anchorated domain, thus reflecting each change of the latter in
            the former.<br><br>

            Concept| Description
            BAR | An archive that stores files that were previously divided into blocks called bricks. A BAR is referenced by its SEED. The SEED could be also used to encrypt the archive.

            CSB | An encrypted BAR that contains a blockchain.

            SEED | A string used to derive the encryption keys for  BARs. It is also used for referencing BARs.

            SEED Cage | A dictionary that stores domainAliases and SEEDs.

            PIN | A string used to derive the key used for the SEED Cage encryption.

            Domain | A domain is a CSB that stores domain constitutions.

            Domain Constitution | A list of files that contain assets and transactions used for the manipulation of a domain’s blockchain.
